**The Elixir Toolkit to Train and Run Small LLMs**

## Introduction

This repository is pretty much a WIP, but the plan is to implement building blocks to allow users to create and host their own small LLMs using Elixir. As I'm learning about AI and buiding LLMs, I'm going to update this repo with new things, as I find them interesting.

I took as inspiration the following references

- [Nanochat](https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat) by Karpathy
- [Build a LLM from Scratch](https://www.manning.com/books/build-a-large-language-model-from-scratch) by Sebastian Raschka

## Objectives

The main objetive is to create something that may be useful for some people, while having fun and experimenting new things.
